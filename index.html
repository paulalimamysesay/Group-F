                            <p>Yoni, Sierra LeoneThe Company’s Yoni Plantation consists of over 21,000 hectares of flat
                                and fertile land located in the
                                Tonkolili District of Sierra Leone, 90 miles from Freetown, the country’s capital, and
                                adjacent to the country’s major highway into Freetown.
                                The Company is growing short-rotation species including Eucalyptus and Acacia. Due to
                                the proximity of the land to Freetown, and substantial deep-water port facilities, the
                                Company has good access to timber export markets.Due to the proximity of the land to
                                Freetown, and substantial deep-water port facilities, the Company has good access to
                                timber export markets.
                                The Yoni Plantation is around 8.5° north of the equator and has a tropical climate with
                                average monthly temperatures ranging between 26°C and 36°C
                                and annual rainfall in excess of 2,000mm. The dry season typically spans between
                                December and March having less than 100mm of rainfall.The land on which the Company is
                                establishing plantation forests was once forested with primary forest,
                                however the land now consists of secondary growth including grasses, low level bush and
                                palms. The land is being leased
                                under longterm agreements with landowners ratified by the chief’s and government as
                                legal custodians.</p>
