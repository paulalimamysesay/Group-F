                        Yoni, Sierra Leone
                        The Company’s Yoni Plantation consists of over 21,000 hectares of flat and fertile land located
                        in the Tonkolili District of Sierra Leone, 90 miles from Freetown, the country’s capital, and
                        adjacent to the country’s major highway into Freetown. The Company is growing short-rotation
                        species including Eucalyptus and Acacia. Due to the proximity of the land to Freetown, and
                        substantial deep-water port facilities, the Company has good access to timber export markets.

                        The Yoni Plantation is around 8.5° north of the equator and has a tropical climate with average
                        monthly temperatures ranging between 26°C and 36°C and annual rainfall in excess of 2,000mm. The
                        dry season typically spans between December and March having less than 100mm of rainfall.
                        The land on which the Company is establishing plantation forests was once forested with primary
                        forest, however the land now consists of secondary growth including grasses, low level bush and
                        palms. The land is being leased under longterm agreements with landowners ratified by the
                        chief’s and government as legal custodians.</p>
