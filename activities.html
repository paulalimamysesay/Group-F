        <p>The Company knows that good relationships with its employees and community are critical for long term
          success. Miro strives for proactive, mutually respectful and lasting relationships with all of its
          stakeholders. With local communities having a vested interest in the success of the Company, they work to
          promote and protect it.

          Miro communicates meaningfully and transparently through its all inclusive stakeholder engagement plans and
          teams of dedicated and experienced Community Liaison Officers. In this way we ensure we are listening to,
          learning from and taking into account the views of all of our stakeholders, using open and relevant dialogue
          that respects and uphold our values.</p>

        <P>Miro Forestry's community development strategy includes education, access to clean water and alternative
          livelihood programs. Our mission for community development is to help communities help themselves. While many
          development interventions over the past few decades have perpetuated the dependency mindset, Miro Forestry's
          projects exist to challenge this by empowering the communities to achieve their own objectives. The
          communities see the company as a true partner whilst not depending on the company for their daily needs.</p>

        <P>The company welcomes working on community projects in partnership with NGOs and other organisations and
          individuals whereby greater financial support can be provided to a project together with additional and
          specialist expertise. </p>

        <h1 id="environment protection and employment">Environment Protection and Employment</h1>
        <p>Whilst the Company is primarily a commercial timber operation, we believe strongly in the conservation and
          regeneration of indigenous flora, fauna and habitats. The Company therefore aims to ensure that
          environmentally sensitive areas, such as those along the edge of rivers and wildlife corridors are conserved
          and regenerated. Miro conserves all areas of natural forest, cultural heritage and other valuable habitats.

          The Company's projects follow ecological and environmental principles, working closely with national
          environmental regulatory bodies and has a strong, experienced team working to ensure the highest environmental
          standards are achieved. The Company ensures the land is used wisely and maintained for the use of generations
          to come.</p>
